This is why it is good to watch a lot of tutorials so you know what to search for:

**My** google search query\*\* : "how to write javascript conditional in html template literal"

**Answer**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45676974/using-conditionals-inside-template-literals

**Example**: `<td> ${project.progress || ''} </td>` in the main index.html file.
I was searching for things like this: "if undefined return blank javascript". But then I remembered the term template literals and conditionals and it helped me search for the right things. This experience is a good example of learning a lot of right content before searching. One line solution is really interesting. I thought it would take multiple lines or some work outside the for loop. It turned out to be really simple.

I made some progress on the skilled-elearning-landing-page. I am getting easily frustrated of cropping images. I am getting a bit bored of the challenges writing html and css.

Today, I completed most of the challenge [single page design portfolio]. I have learned a lot. I had a lot of practice with flexbox and grid.

The things I am proud of is my growing ability to work with breakpoints. Using grid was so easy with understading of how grid template areas work.

I also learned how to efficiently work with figma. I still have a long way to make the process faster. But I'm glad to have figma files. The subscription is very much worth it.

I also hesitantly started with mobile-first design. I didn't like it at the beginning. But in the end, I can see how the process unfolded and it worked out just fine. It appears, preliminarily, that working with media queries was much simple.

I loved using unset property. Taking time to learn that helped so much. Even more, the absolute/relative positioning with top bottom right left concept was so useful. Without it, I would have been completely lost.

The main thing with the scrimba and frontend mentor approach is that I can effectively avoid stack overflow and google. Contrary to popular opinion, I think google is less effective.

Using absolute values helps fix frontend mentor pixel perfect issue.
